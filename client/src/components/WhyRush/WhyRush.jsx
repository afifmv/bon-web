  "Beta Theta Pi is one of the top fraternities on campus, excelling in academics, sports, philanthropy, and campus involvement. Founded in 1936, our fraternity is the only one on campus that owns its own house and land. We have won the IFC Sports Trophy 37 times in the last 50 years, and we have produced the most Rhodes scholars (eight) of any Beta chapter worldwide. Our chapter has also had two of our members serve the role of Interfraternity Council President two years in a row, along with many other members holding other important positions on the Interfraternity Council. With a membership roll of over 2000 members and a strong alumni association, Beta Theta Pi holds a strong presence in the Vancouver business community.";
